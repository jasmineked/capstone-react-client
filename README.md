Unsolved problems
Continue integrating Plaid's API to fetch user's financial info such as transactions and income. Currently Plaid link does not work. 

Planning, process and problem-solving strategy:
Very minimal planning, mostly because I had no idea what I wanted to do so I focused on reaching MVP.
Resolved my bugs using the debugger tab in Firefox's dev tools. Observed the cycle using Stack Trace & utilized XHR breakpoints to stop loading the page before & after bugs. This helped me findd the origin which wasn't always located where my dev servers indicated. I hope this makes sense because no one I've explained this to so far understands...I also realized '$git push origin' publishes all my commits to my repo & that's why you can't see my attempt at integrating Plaid.


Wireframes:
CSS is a great skill to flex, if you've got it. I do not. 
Lo & behold, thee wireframes.
