*** Planning, process and problem-solving strategy: ***

Very minimal planning, focused on functionality. Started at the end & 

I resolved my bugs using the debugger tab in Firefox's dev tools. Observed the cycle using Stack Trace & utilized XHR breakpointsto stop process before & after bugs. This heped me determine each  bug's origin which wasn't always located where my dev servers indicated. I hope this makes sense because no one I've explained this to so far understands...I also realized git push origin publishes all my changes to my repo & this relieved so much anxiety, as I've realized my classmates actually enjoy looking at one another's projects & honestly, that's just not my thing. Knowing this gave me so much more freedom to create and destroy :)
