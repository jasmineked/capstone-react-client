Unsolved problems:

Continue integrating Plaid's API to fetch user's financial info such as transactions and income. Currently the Plaid link (onIndexBudgets) does not work. I haven't pushed any updated files with Plaid's API...almost finsihed working out the bugs. Unfortunately, the version I downloaded required public_keys and since July 2020, they've replaced it with a link_token. I researched a ton & even created a MERNstack from scratch using Plaid's API. This wasted a lot of time but I finally have a 404 error which is much better than "missing public_key"!!! right?


Planning, process and problem-solving strategy:

Very minimal planning, mostly because I had no idea what I wanted to do (still don't) so I focused on reaching MVP.
Resolved my bugs using the debugger tab in Firefox's dev tools. Observed the cycle using Stack Trace & utilized XHR breakpoints to stop loading the page before & after bugs.  I hope this makes sense. 


Wireframes:
CSS is a great skill to flex, if you've got it. I do not. 
Lo & behold, thee wireframes.
